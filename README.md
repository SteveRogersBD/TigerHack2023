Project Name: FitStream
Overview: An app which helps users get fit by providing educated workout and dietary plans based on the user’s BMI.

What it does:
The app contains a collection of exercises which helps the user to master those techniques. It also provides a BMI calculator which as a result creates a educated workout and dietary plan for the user to follow in order to reach his goal. It also contains fitstream which works as the fitness version of youtube where users can livestream workout related contents. Lastly, the app contains FitConnect which allows users to connect with different users from across the world where they can view their workout as well as their dietary plans as well.

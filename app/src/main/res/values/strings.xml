        To perform a concentration curl, sit on a bench with your feet flat and hold a dumbbell in one
        hand, placing your arms back against your inner thigh. Fully extend your arm, allowing the
        dumbbell to hang down, then curl it towards your shoulder while keeping your upper arm
        stationary. Squeeze your bicep at the top of the movement, lower the weight with control,
        and complete the desired reps. Afterward, switch to the other arm. Maintaining proper form
        and focusing on the contraction is crucial for an effective bicep workout.
